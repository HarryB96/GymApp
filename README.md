# GymApp
A Xamarin Forms Application to keep track of my Gym Activities

## Features
This app is able to keep track of my workout routine, as well as the weights used in the previous workout, which enables me to improve with every session. This app will also calculate and keep track of my One Rep Maxes. Finally this app includes a stopwatch, which is extremely useful during a workout.

## Technologies Used
In building this app I have utilised SQLite, Xamarin Forms and a REST API.
